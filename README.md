## Introduction

This document provides a brief overview of the `FourMarket`, `Market`, and `Token` smart contracts. These contracts form a decentralized prediction market platform where users can create markets, place bets on outcomes, and receive rewards based on the actual results.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git**: Version control system for cloning and managing repositories.
  - **Installation**: Follow the official [Git installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
  - **Verification**: Run `git --version` in your terminal. You should see output like `git version x.x.x`.

- **Foundry**: A blazing fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.
  - **Installation**: Use the command provided at [Foundry's official website](https://getfoundry.sh/).
  - **Verification**: Run `forge --version` in your terminal. Expected output is similar to `forge x.x.x`.

- **Yarn**: Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management for JavaScript projects.
  - **Installation**: Follow the [Yarn installation guide](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).
    ```bash
    # Install Yarn globally using npm
    npm install --global yarn
    ```
  - **Verification**: Run the following command to confirm installation:
    ```bash
    yarn --version
    ```


## Quickstart

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/group4market/4Market.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd 4Market

# Compile
forge build
```

# FourMarket, Market, and Token Contracts Overview

## FourMarket Contract

### Deployment (Sepolia)
- [0x1c6AbAaf5b8a410Ae89d30C84a0123173DaabfA3](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1c6abaaf5b8a410ae89d30c84a0123173daabfa3)

### Purpose

- Acts as a factory and registry for creating and managing individual prediction markets.
- Allows users to create new markets with specific parameters.

### How It Works

- **Create Market**: Users call the `createMarket()` function with the desired parameters:
  - `_question`: The question or event for the market.
  - `_details`: Additional information about the market.
  - `_deadline`: Timestamp when betting closes.
  - `_resolutionTime`: Time window for resolving the market.
  - `_resolver`: Address responsible for resolving the market.

- **Market Registry**: Newly created markets are stored in the `markets` mapping with a unique `marketId`.

## Market Contract

### Purpose

- Represents an individual prediction market.
- Handles bet placement, market resolution, and reward distribution.

### Key Features

- **Bet Placement**:
  - Users place bets by sending Ether and specifying an outcome (`Yes` or `No`).
  - Bets can only be placed before the `i_deadline`.
  - Users receive `YesToken` or `NoToken` representing their stake.

- **Market Resolution**:
  - After the betting deadline, the designated `i_resolver` can resolve the market by calling `resolve()` with the final outcome.
  - Resolution must occur within the `i_resolutionTime` window.

- **Reward Distribution**:
  - Users can claim rewards by calling `distribute()` after the market is resolved.
  - Rewards are proportional to their stake in the winning outcome.
  - Tokens are burned upon claiming rewards.

- **Inactivity Cancellation**:
  - If the market is not resolved within the resolution window, anyone can call `inactivityCancel()` to cancel the market.
  - Users can then retrieve their original bets.

### User Actions

- **For Participants**:
  - **Place a Bet**:
    1. Call `bet(outcomeType _betOutcome)` with your chosen outcome.
    2. Send the amount of Ether you wish to bet.
  - **Claim Rewards**:
    1. After the market is resolved, call `distribute()` to claim your rewards.

- **For Market Creators**:
  - **Create a Market**:
    1. Call `createMarket()` on the `FourMarket` contract with the desired parameters.
    2. Set yourself or another trusted entity as the `i_resolver`.

- **For Resolvers**:
  - **Resolve the Market**:
    1. After the betting deadline and within the resolution window, call `resolve(outcomeType _finalResolution)` with the actual outcome.

---

## Token Contract

### Purpose

- ERC20 tokens representing users' stakes in a market outcome.
- Two types: `YesToken` and `NoToken`.

### Key Features

- **Minting**:
  - Only the market contract (`i_deployer`) can mint tokens when users place bets.

- **Burning**:
  - Tokens are burned when users claim rewards.

---

## Summary

- **Participants**: Place bets on market outcomes and claim rewards based on actual results.
- **Creators**: Use the `FourMarket` contract to create new markets.
- **Resolvers**: Responsible for setting the final outcome of a market within the specified resolution window.

## Note

- The code may contain vulnerabilities or bugs that could result in loss of funds if deployed in a live environment.
- Critical features such as advanced error handling, edge-case coverage, and comprehensive testing are not implemented.
- The contracts are designed for educational purposes and should not be relied upon for real-world applications.
